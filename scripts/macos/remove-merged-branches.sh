# Remove local branches whose upstream was deleted after the pull request merged.
#
# Intended as the opening step of a working session, and especially useful in a
# clone that several people or agents share.
#
# When a pull request is squash-merged and its head branch is deleted on the
# remote, the local branch stays behind, and `git branch -d` refuses to remove
# it: a squashed commit has a different SHA than the branch it came from, so the
# branch never looks fully merged. This script decides on upstream state rather
# than commit reachability. A branch counts as merged once it had an upstream and
# that upstream is gone.
#
# That makes the sweep safe by construction. A branch that was never pushed has
# no upstream at all and can never be reported as gone, so local-only work is
# never swept. Branches checked out in another worktree are reported and skipped,
# and the default branch is never removed.
#
# Run `git config --global fetch.prune true` once per machine so the gone markers
# appear without passing --prune on every fetch.
#
# Usage: ./remove-merged-branches.sh [OPTIONS]
#
# Options:
#   -n, --dry-run              Show what would be removed without changing anything
#   -r, --return-to-default    Switch to the default branch and fast-forward afterwards
#   -s, --skip-fetch           Skip `git fetch --prune`
#   -C, --repository-root DIR  Operate on DIR instead of the current repository
#   -h, --help                 Show this help message
